# libtess.js

Polygon tesselation library, ported from the tesselator in Silicon Graphics,
Inc's
[reference implementation](http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/index.html) of
the OpenGL Utility Library (GLU).

### Tesselator or Tessellator?

Probably tessellator, but `GLUtesselator`, etc is in the original GLU API handed
down from Ancient Times and "tesselator" is already all over the original source
code, so that's what we're going with.
